# EXP1_BasicCalculator

# Aim
To:

1. Display a simple "Hello, World!" message using a basic C++ program.
2. Create a calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations using user input.
# Tool Used
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
# Objectives
- Understand the structure of a C++ program.
-Learn the use of #include to add libraries.
-Use cin and cout for input and output operations.
-Implement arithmetic operations in C++.
-Understand syntax like using namespace std;, function structure, and data types.
-Learn to comment code using // for clarity and readability.
# Theory
C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that is an extension of the C programming language. It includes object-oriented features, strong type checking, and rich libraries. C++ is widely used for system-level programming, embedded systems, and software development that requires performance and efficiency.

# Why C++ is Better than C
C++ offers multiple advantages over C which makes it more suitable for modern software development:

-C++ supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. This helps in organizing complex programs, reusing code, and simplifying maintenance.
-It has function overloading and operator overloading, allowing multiple definitions for the same function/operator depending on parameters.
-It provides the Standard Template Library (STL), which includes reusable code like vectors, lists, stacks, queues, maps, and algorithms.
-C++ introduces stronger type safety, helping catch more errors during compilation.
-It supports encapsulation and abstraction, which hide implementation details and make programs easier to manage.
-Memory management is improved through the use of constructors, destructors, and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
-Namespaces help avoid name conflicts in larger programs by grouping functions, classes, and objects logically.
-These features make C++ more powerful, scalable, and user-friendly compared to C, especially for large and complex applications.

# Program Structure in C++
-#include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive used to include the standard input-output stream library, which provides cin, cout, and endl.
-using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the standard C++ library namespace, so we don’t have to prefix std:: each time.
-int main() is the starting point of a C++ program. Every executable C++ program must have a main function.
-cout is used to output data to the console, and cin is used to take user input.
-Conditional statements like if and else allow decision making based on specific conditions.
-Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are used for basic mathematical calculations.
-Data types like int, float, and double help define what kind of data a variable can hold.
-return 0; signals successful termination of the program.
-Comments are written using // and are ignored by the compiler. They help explain the logic of the code.
# Program Description
# Part 1: Hello World
This is a simple program that prints “Hello, World!” to the output console.
It introduces the basic syntax of a C++ program including headers, main function, and output statement.
# Part 2: Calculator Program
This program allows the user to input two numbers and performs the following operations:

-Addition
-Subtraction
-Multiplication
-Division
The results of each operation are then displayed using the cout statement. The program uses basic arithmetic operators and variables to store the results.

# Concepts Used
-Header files: #include <iostream>
-Namespaces: using namespace std;
-Input/Output: cin, cout
-Functions: main(), return 0;
-Variables and Data Types: int, float, double
-Operators: +, -, *, /
-Conditional Statements: if, else
# Comments: 
// Sample Output
Hello World
Enter num1 : 22
Enter num_2 : 333
Sum : 355
Difference : -311
Product : 7326
Division : 0.0660661
# Notes
-Variable names should begin with a letter or underscore. They may contain numbers after the first character.
float provides decimal support, while double offers more precision.
-It’s good practice to check for division by zero when performing division.
-Always indent and comment your code for better readability and maintainability.
-To compile and run the program:
  -Use g++ filename.cpp -o output in terminal to compile.
  -Run using ./output (Linux/Mac) or output.exe (Windows).
-Use comments to explain key steps in your code, especially in academic or collaborative environments.
